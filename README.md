# The Predictability of the NBA Draft

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro
The aim of this project is to investigate the factors that influence the performance of rookie players in the NBA. While previous studies have focused on how players' skills impact their pick order in the NBA Draft, there has been limited research exploring the reverse relationship. Our goal is to assess the predictability of the NBA Draft and its potential impact on rookie players' sports careers, examining how it may either enhance or diminish their performance in the league.

## Project Description
We obtained four datasets through two websites, Kaggle and Basketball Reference. One contains the list of NBA draft picks over the years along with their respective draft positions. The other three consist of game data for all NBA players in the 2020-2021, 2021-2022, and 2022-2023 seasons, respectively. With this information, we attempt to investigate the research question what is the correlation between draft decisions and the future performance of rookie players in the NBA by creating a regression model and analyzing it. We hypothesize that draft positions are the major factor that affects rookie playersâ€™ performance in NBA.
